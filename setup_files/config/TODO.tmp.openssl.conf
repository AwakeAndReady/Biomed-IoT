# In a local encironment, does a self signed certificate work with my ip address as well as my machines name like "my-computer"?

# Yes, you can create a self-signed certificate that covers both an IP address and a machine name (e.g., "my-computer"). 
# When you create a certificate, the common name (CN) and Subject Alternative Names (SAN) can be used to 
# specify the domains and IP addresses the certificate should cover.
# Here's how you can create a self-signed certificate that covers both:

# 1. Create a Configuration File
# To make things easier and clearer, you can use a configuration file for OpenSSL.
# Let's call it openssl.cnf. Here's a basic example:

[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha256
prompt             = no
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions     = req_ext

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C  = US
ST = YourState
L  = YourCity
O  = YourOrg
OU = YourOrgUnit
CN = my-computer

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1   = my-computer
IP.1    = 192.168.1.10

# Replace the placeholders (YourState, YourCity, etc.) with appropriate values for your organization or use. 
# Adjust the CN value and the values under [alt_names] to match your machine's name and IP address.

# 2. Generate the Certificate Using the Configuration File
# Use the openssl command with the configuration file:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/my-computer.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/my-computer.crt -config openssl.cnf

# 3. Verify the Certificate
# After generating the certificate, you can verify its contents:
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/my-computer.crt -text -noout
# Ensure that both the IP address and the machine name (e.g., "my-computer") are present in the "Subject" or "Subject Alternative Name" fields.
# Use the Certificate
# Configure your server or service to use the generated certificate (my-computer.crt) and the corresponding private key (my-computer.key). When accessing the service, you can use either the machine name (my-computer) or the IP address (192.168.1.10) without encountering certificate domain mismatch errors.
# However, since it's a self-signed certificate, you'll still get a warning in browsers about the certificate not being issued by a recognized authority. In internal or controlled environments, this is generally acceptable, and you can proceed with an exception or import the certificate into the trusted store of client systems or browsers.
